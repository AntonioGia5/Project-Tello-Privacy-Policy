# Project-Tello
Project-Tello is a project born in the Apple Developer Academy from the passions of sic students, automotive and technology. 
We would improve the driving experience of every day making it safer and more efficient.

The app analise your driving style through the use of the iPhone sensors, localisation sensors and camera. It can recognise some sudden events while you are driving throgh the use of sensors and artificial intelligence. At the end of a trip the app calculate three different scores (attention, speed and smoothness) that makes with the same weight the final score. This score create a ranking between all the users of the app.

How to use the app:
You just need to put your iPhone in a stable support and start a drive, without external sensors!
It is simple. Just start the app, tap on the central button and start drive! 


We would love to hear about your thoughts on how we can improve the app. You can contact us through our email or our facebook page.

Future feature:
In the next future we would add some other feature as some widget in the Drive view giving to the user the possibility to personalise his/her experience.
