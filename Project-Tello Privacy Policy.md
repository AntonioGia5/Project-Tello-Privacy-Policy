# Localisation Data, Camera Data, Sensors Data 
Project-Tello is a project born in the Apple Developer Academy during the final challenge. 

It would recognise some action done by a driver during his/her trips, giving it a score that represents the driving style. 

It can be used from drivers to improve their driving style, from rent car/insurance companies to apply personalised fees and from driving school to give a more objective score to its scholars. 

In order to calculate this score, Project-Tello asks the permission to use various sensors as camera, localisation and movement sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). It request this permission at the first start but you can modify them every time you want finding in the settings of the phone. 

# This data are used only locally to calculate your score that is based on three part: Speed Score (localisation), Smoothness Score (accelerometer and gyroscope), Attention Score (camera). These data arenâ€™t stored in any database online or streamed on the net in any way apart from the final score that is shared through all the community of the app together with your username in order to create a ranking. All the trip you make with this application are stored in your private iCloud database so no one can see them apart from you. Your data will not be passed on to any servers, third parties or used for any marketing or promotional purposes.
